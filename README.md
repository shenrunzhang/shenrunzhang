### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an undergrad at Rice interested in computer science, machine learning, and robotics.

Currently working on an ML model to predict the Forex market. My other projects include autonomous vehicle path-finding and control, a computer vision target detection and classification pipeline for the SUAS drone competition, and person re-identification.
